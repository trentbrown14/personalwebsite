  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <div>
  <p>
My name is Trent Brown and I am a student of Professional and Technical Writing. I am currently a senior at Virginia Tech but I will always be a student of writing because as one of my professors has wisely told me, writing is something that you can never practice too much and or be too good at. It's a philosophy that I believe translates into all aspects of life and is something that I invest myself in. Outside of school I enjoy playing music and sports as well as spending time with my friends. I mainly play guitar these days but I got my start playing wind instruments. I have played soccer my entire life and it is my true sports passion but I also play basketball and snowboard during the winter months and surf during the summer. I put my best efforts into all that I do because I believe that that's how you find your boundaries, and that's how you push past them.

<h2>Skills and Experience</h2>
<p>
I have had a very diverse work experience throughout my years and I wouldn't trade it for any other course. Everything that I've done has taught me things and developed skills for me that, together, have made me a well-rounded person. It's not kist work though, but also sports that I played growing up, that have made a great impression on me up to this today. I was exposed to a lot of different things when I was younger and am grateful for my opportunities. I learned more about leadership, teamwork, accountability, and hard work from playing team sports at a young age than I did from any of the jobs that I had. It's because I was so young whe I was exposed to these aspects of life that they had such a profound effect on me. Because of that, I possessed those traits going into the work force and have held on to them ever since.
